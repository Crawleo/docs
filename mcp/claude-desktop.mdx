## Overview

Connect Crawleo to Anthropic's Claude Desktop application to give Claude real-time web search and crawling capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Desktop installed ([download](https://claude.ai/download))
- Active Crawleo subscription with API key

<Info>
  MCP tools use the same credits as the REST API. `search_web` costs 10 credits per page, and `crawl_web` costs 1-10 credits per page based on proxy settings. [View pricing](/credits-pricing)
</Info>

## Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Claude Desktop Settings">
    Open Claude Desktop and navigate to **Settings** → **Developer** → **Edit Config**.
    
    This opens the `claude_desktop_config.json` file.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Crawleo MCP Server">
    Add the Crawleo MCP configuration to your config file:
    
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "crawleo": {
          "url": "https://api.crawleo.dev/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Crawleo API key.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restart Claude Desktop">
    Close and reopen Claude Desktop to load the new configuration.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Connection">
    Look for the MCP tools icon (hammer) in the chat interface. Click it to see the available Crawleo tools:
