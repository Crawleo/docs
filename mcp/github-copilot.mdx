## Overview

Connect Crawleo to GitHub Copilot to enhance it with real-time web search and crawling capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub Copilot subscription
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension
- Active Crawleo subscription with API key

<Info>
  MCP tools use the same credits as the REST API. `search_web` costs 10 credits per page, and `crawl_web` costs 1-10 credits per page based on proxy settings. [View pricing](/credits-pricing)
</Info>

## Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open VS Code Settings">
    Open VS Code and go to **Settings** (`Cmd+,` on macOS or `Ctrl+,` on Windows/Linux).
    
    Search for "MCP" or navigate to the GitHub Copilot extension settings.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure MCP Server">
    Add the Crawleo MCP server configuration:
    
    ```json
    {
      "github.copilot.chat.mcpServers": {
        "crawleo": {
          "url": "https://api.crawleo.dev/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restart VS Code">
    Restart VS Code to apply the configuration changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manual Configuration

Edit your VS Code `settings.json` directly:

1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Search for "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"
3. Add the Crawleo configuration:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.mcpServers": {
    "crawleo": {
      "url": "https://api.crawleo.dev/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Use Cases

Once connected, use Crawleo with GitHub Copilot Chat:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Documentation" icon="book">
    ```
    @workspace Search for the OpenAI API documentation and show me 
    how to use function calling.
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Library Research" icon="magnifying-glass">
    ```
    Search for the best TypeScript validation libraries and 
    compare Zod vs Yup vs Joi.
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Error Solutions" icon="bug">
    ```
    Search for solutions to "CORS error in fetch request" 
    and explain the fixes.
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Crawl Documentation" icon="spider-web">
    ```
    Crawl https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html and 
    create a cheat sheet for Express routing.
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using with @workspace

Combine Crawleo's web capabilities with Copilot's workspace understanding:

```
Search for best practices for the framework used in my project 
and suggest improvements to my codebase.
```

This allows Copilot to:
1. Understand your project context
2. Search for relevant best practices
3. Apply suggestions to your specific code
