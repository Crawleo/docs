## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables AI assistants to connect directly to external tools and data sources. Crawleo provides native MCP support, allowing AI assistants to search the web and crawl URLs without custom integration code.

## MCP Endpoint

```
https://api.crawleo.dev/mcp
```

## Available Tools

When connected via MCP, AI assistants have access to two tools:

## Quick Setup

The basic configuration pattern is the same across all platforms:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crawleo": {
      "url": "https://api.crawleo.dev/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Select your platform from the navigation to see detailed setup instructions.

## Example Usage

Once configured, you can ask your AI assistant things like:

- *"Search for the latest news about artificial intelligence"*
- *"Crawl this documentation page and summarize it"*
- *"Find and compare pricing from these three websites"*
- *"Research the top Python web frameworks and their features"*

The AI will automatically use Crawleo's tools to fetch real-time web data.
