## API Key Authentication

All Crawleo API requests require authentication using your API key.

### Getting Your API Key

1. Sign up at [crawleo.dev/login](https://www.crawleo.dev/login)
2. Subscribe to a plan at [crawleo.dev/pricing](https://www.crawleo.dev/pricing)
3. Access your API key from the dashboard

### Using Your API Key

Include your API key in one of the following headers:

**Option 1: Authorization Header (Bearer Token)**

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Option 2: X-API-Key Header**

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

Both methods are equivalent - use whichever is more convenient for your application.

### Example Request

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL (Authorization Header)
curl -X GET "https://api.crawleo.dev/search?query=hello" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```


```bash cURL (x-api-key Header)
```


```python Python
```


```javascript JavaScript
```

</CodeGroup>

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

  <Accordion title="Use Environment Variables" icon="lock">
    Store your API key in environment variables rather than hardcoding it:

    ```bash
    export CRAWLEO_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```

    ```python
    import os
    api_key = os.environ.get("CRAWLEO_API_KEY")
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Server-Side Only" icon="server">
    Make API calls from your backend server, not from browser-based JavaScript.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate Keys Regularly" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Periodically rotate your API keys, especially if you suspect they may have been compromised.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Credits System

API usage is tracked using credits. Each API call deducts credits from your monthly allowance based on your subscription plan.

### Credit Costs

| API Endpoint               | Credits Cost                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Search API                 | 10 credits per page of results |
| Crawl API (no proxy)       | 1 credit per page              |
| Crawl API (standard proxy) | 2 credits per page             |
| Crawl API (premium proxy)  | 10 credits per page            |

### Subscription Plans

| Plan      | Credits/Month | Concurrent Requests | Price       |

## Concurrent Request Limits

Each plan has a maximum number of concurrent requests. If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a `429` response with the message:

```
Concurrent request limit reached ({limit}). Please wait for other requests to finish.
```
