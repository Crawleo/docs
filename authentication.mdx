## API Key Authentication

All Crawleo API requests require authentication using a Bearer token.

### Getting Your API Key

1. Sign up at [crawleo.dev/login](https://www.crawleo.dev/login)
2. Subscribe to a plan at [crawleo.dev/pricing](https://www.crawleo.dev/pricing)
3. Access your API key from the dashboard

### Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Request

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.crawleo.dev/api/v1/search?query=hello" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
}

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.crawleo.dev/api/v1/search",
    params={"query": "hello"},
    headers=headers
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.crawleo.dev/api/v1/search?query=hello",
  {
    headers: {
      "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
    }
  }
);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

  <Accordion title="Use Environment Variables" icon="lock">
    Store your API key in environment variables rather than hardcoding it:
    
    ```bash
    export CRAWLEO_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```
    
    ```python
    import os
    api_key = os.environ.get("CRAWLEO_API_KEY")
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Server-Side Only" icon="server">
    Make API calls from your backend server, not from browser-based JavaScript.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rotate Keys Regularly" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Periodically rotate your API keys, especially if you suspect they may have been compromised.

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate-limited based on your subscription plan. If you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Error Responses

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `401` | Invalid or missing API key |
| `403` | API key doesn't have access to this resource |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded |
