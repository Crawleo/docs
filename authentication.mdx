## API Key Authentication

All Crawleo API requests require authentication using your API key.

### Getting Your API Key

1. Sign up at [crawleo.dev/login](https://www.crawleo.dev/login)
2. Subscribe to a plan at [crawleo.dev/pricing](https://www.crawleo.dev/pricing)
3. Access your API key from the dashboard

### Using Your API Key

Include your API key in one of the following headers:

**Option 1: Authorization Header (Bearer Token)**
```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Option 2: X-API-Key Header**
```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

Both methods are equivalent - use whichever is more convenient for your application.

### Example Request

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL (Authorization Header)
curl -X GET "https://api.crawleo.dev/search?query=hello" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```bash cURL (x-api-key Header)
curl -X GET "https://api.crawleo.dev/search?query=hello" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
}

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.crawleo.dev/search",
    params={"query": "hello"},
    headers=headers
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.crawleo.dev/search?query=hello",
  {
    headers: {
      "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
    }
  }
);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Environment Variables" icon="lock">
    Store your API key in environment variables rather than hardcoding it:
    
    ```bash
    export CRAWLEO_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```
    
    ```python
    import os
    api_key = os.environ.get("CRAWLEO_API_KEY")
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Server-Side Only" icon="server">
    Make API calls from your backend server, not from browser-based JavaScript.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rotate Keys Regularly" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Periodically rotate your API keys, especially if you suspect they may have been compromised.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Credits System

API usage is tracked using credits. Each API call deducts credits from your monthly allowance based on your subscription plan.

| Plan | Credits/Month | Concurrent Requests |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| Free Plan - 1K | 10,000 | 1 |
| Developer - 10k | 100,000 | 3 |
| Pro - 100K | 1,000,000 | 5 |
| Scale 250K | 2,500,000 | 10 |

## Concurrent Request Limits

Each plan has a maximum number of concurrent requests. If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a `429` response with the message:

```
Concurrent request limit reached ({limit}). Please wait for other requests to finish.
```

## Error Responses

| Status Code | Description | Error Message |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| `401` | Invalid or missing API key | - |
| `403` | API key doesn't have access to this resource | - |
| `429` | Credits exhausted | `"Credits exhausted. Please upgrade your plan."` |
| `429` | Concurrent limit reached | `"Concurrent request limit reached ({limit}). Please wait for other requests to finish."` |
