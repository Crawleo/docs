## Our Privacy Commitment

Crawleo is built from the ground up with privacy as a core principle. We believe you should be able to access web data without compromising your privacy or your users' privacy.

## Data We Process

We only process minimal data necessary for service operation:

| Data Type | Purpose | Retention |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| API Key | Authentication | Until account deletion |
| Credits Usage | Billing & usage tracking | Aggregated monthly |
| Error Logs | Service debugging | Short-term (auto-deleted) |

<Note>
  We do **not** log your search queries, URLs, or the content we crawl for you.
</Note>

## Technical Implementation

### Stateless Architecture

Crawleo runs on a serverless architecture using Google Cloud Functions:

- **Stateless execution:** Each request is independent
- **No persistent storage:** Content flows through, not stored
- **Automatic scaling:** No data accumulation
- **Ephemeral processing:** Content discarded after response

### Secure Communication

- All API traffic uses **HTTPS encryption**
- API keys transmitted securely
- No plaintext data transmission

## Compliance

Crawleo's privacy-first design is built to be compatible with:

  <Card title="GDPR" icon="flag">
    European General Data Protection Regulation
  </Card>
  <Card title="CCPA" icon="flag">
    California Consumer Privacy Act
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access:** Know what data we have about you (minimal account info only)
- **Deletion:** Request deletion of your account and associated data
- **Portability:** Export your account information
- **Objection:** Object to processing (contact support)
