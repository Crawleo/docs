## Overview

Crawleo uses a **credits-based billing system** that gives you flexibility and predictability in your API usage. Credits are deducted from your monthly allowance based on which API endpoints you use and their configuration.

## Credit Costs

### Search API

| Operation | Credits Cost |
|-----------|-------------|
| Search (per page of results) | **10 credits** |

<Info>
  Each page of search results (controlled by `max_pages` parameter) costs 10 credits. For example, searching with `max_pages=3` will cost 30 credits.
</Info>

### Crawl API

| Proxy Setting | Credits Cost |
|---------------|-------------|
| No proxy (default) | **1 credit** per page |
| Standard proxy (`use_proxies=true`) | **2 credits** per page |
| Premium proxy (`use_premium_proxies=true`) | **10 credits** per page |

<Tip>
  Use premium proxies only when necessary (e.g., for geo-restricted content or sites with strong bot protection). Default crawling without proxies is the most cost-effective.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Appropriate Proxy Levels" icon="shield">
    - Start with **no proxy** (1 credit) for most sites
    - Use **standard proxy** (2 credits) for basic geo-targeting
    - Reserve **premium proxy** (10 credits) for protected sites
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Optimize Search Depth" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Only request the number of search pages you need. Each additional page costs 10 credits.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Batch Crawl Requests" icon="layer-group">
    Crawl multiple URLs in a single request when possible to reduce overhead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cache Results" icon="database">
    Cache crawled content on your side to avoid re-crawling the same URLs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limits

In addition to credits, each plan has concurrent request limits:

| Plan | Concurrent Requests |
|------|---------------------|
| Free | 5 |
| Developer | 20 |
| Pro | 50 |
| Scale | 100 |

If you exceed your concurrent request limit, you'll receive a `429` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "CONCURRENT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "Concurrent request limit reached (5). Please wait for other requests to finish."
  }
}
```
